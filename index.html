            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>The purpose of the "Meta Agent with More Agents" project is to dynamically solve complex queries by breaking them down into smaller tasks and assigning each to specialized AI agents. The Meta Agent coordinates the process, leveraging a ReAct Agent for tool-based tasks and a Chain of Thought Agent for reasoning-based tasks.</p>
